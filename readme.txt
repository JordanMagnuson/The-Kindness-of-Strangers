The Kindness of Strangers
A microgame by Jordan Magnuson 
Created for GameTrekking.com
========================================================================

Language:	AS3

Libraries:	Flashpunk (flashpunk.net)
		Noel Berry's Advanced Platform Engine

Built in:	FlashDevelop (project file included)

The source code for this game is completely free and open: use it
in whatever way you'd like. If you find it helpful, or make anything
particular with it, I'd love to hear about it! Send an email to
jordan@gametrekking.com .

Notes: 

- The game was built on top of Berry's APE (a brilliant engine) in a 
  terribly haphazard way. If you're interested in the platform engine, 
  I suggest that you download the lastest version of APE separately.

- The FlashPunk library is covered by its own license, which can be found 
  in the flashpunk directory.
